A simple program that, given a directory and a word to be searched, lists all the files in the given directory (and its sub-directories) that contain that word.

Please make sure that "sbt" is installed on your machine.

To execute the program or to run the tests, do the following. 

1. Change to project directory.
 
2. Type "sbt" on command prompt.

    ```
    $ sbt
    ```

3. In order to run the tests, type "test".

    ```
    $ test
    ```

4. In order to run the program, type "run dirPath WordToBeSearched".

    ```
    $ run testDir orange
    ```
